I am a first-year PhD in the [department of Economics & Public Policy](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/faculty-research/academic-areas/economics-public-policy/) at Imperial College London Business School. I obtained both my B.A and M.A. degrees in Economics at Peking University. My research interests fall at the intersection of Empirical Industrial Organization and Health Economics.
